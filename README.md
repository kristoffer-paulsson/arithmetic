# Kotlin arithmetic coding

This library is a Kotlin port of [Project Nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/page/reference-arithmetic-coding)'s reference arithmetic coding implementation. 
The intent is to provide a functional version of arithmetic coding to the Kotlin language with a later production ready version.
Adaptions have been made to adhere to Kotlin programming paradigms and KMP project layouts, futher adaptions may be done for production ready availability.

All care has been taken to ensure the correctness of the implemented algorithms. Also Nayuki's original unit tests has carefully been ported and preserved for correctness.
